# Emmy Hackathon — write a PTX compiler for Kernel IR

Emmy (github.com/cloudrift-ai/emmy) compiles PyTorch to CUDA C++ and builds it with `nvcc`.
**Your task: write a compiler that takes Emmy's Kernel IR and emits PTX directly**, skipping the
CUDA C++ step. `ptxas` turns PTX into the same GPU binary ~19× faster than the full `nvcc`
pipeline — Emmy's autotuner compiles thousands of kernel variants, so that middle step matters.

You do **not** need a GPU. A hosted runner at `http://runner.riftstack.ai:48701` (the default in `submit.py`) compiles
your PTX with `ptxas`, executes it on real hardware, and tells you whether the output is correct. See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

## My Implementation

This repository contains my implementation for the Emmy Hackathon 2026 challenge: compiling Emmy Kernel IR directly to NVIDIA PTX.

### Current progress

The compiler infrastructure is being developed incrementally, starting with the pointwise category.

- **PTX builder:** Generates PTX kernel structure, register declarations, labels, and instructions.
- **Kernel IR loading:** Uses Emmy's IR classes to inspect kernel operations and their bodies.
- **Tile lowering:** Implements initial handling for single-axis tiles, including thread-index setup and bounds checks.
- **Index-expression lowering:** Supports variables, integer literals, and basic integer arithmetic (`+`, `-`, and `*`).

The current implementation is a work in progress. Full statement lowering and end-to-end correctness still need to be validated before claiming support for a problem category.

### Development setup

Python 3.12 or newer is required. Install the dependencies specified by the challenge:

```bash
pip install emmy-ml==0.3.11 numpy requests
```

Run the compiler using the required command-line interface:

```bash
python compile.py problems/p00_scalar_add/k_add_pointwise.ir.json > out.ptx
```

Validate generated PTX syntax with `ptxas` (when available):

```bash
ptxas -arch=sm_89 out.ptx -o /dev/null
```

Run the project's current development tests with:

```bash
python -m tools.test_tile
python -m tools.test_expr
```

These development tests exercise individual lowering components; they do not, by themselves, establish end-to-end kernel correctness. Use the hackathon submission runner to validate a complete kernel once the compiler supports it:

```bash
python submit.py p00_scalar_add --compiler ./compile.py
```

### Implementation scope

The compiler is being built incrementally, with correctness and explicit handling of unsupported IR constructs prioritized over claiming broad support prematurely. Future work includes lowering memory operations and elementwise statements, validating generated kernels on the hosted runner, and expanding support to additional categories.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12 or newer.** The Kernel IR only deserializes through Emmy's own classes:

  ```bash
  pip install emmy-ml==0.3.11       # no torch, no CUDA, no GPU needed
  ```

  This alone reads every problem IR. Torch is **not** needed — it is only required to
  *generate* new IRs from PyTorch expressions, which is optional.

- Your submission is a **program**, not PTX files. It must run as:

  ```bash
  python compile.py path/to/kernel.ir.json > out.ptx
  ```

  This contract matters: submissions are evaluated against a **hidden set** of Kernel IRs in the
  same categories as the open problems. Hardcoding the open set scores nothing.

## Five-minute start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudrift-ai/emmy-hackathon-2026 && cd emmy-hackathon-2026
pip install emmy-ml==0.3.11 numpy requests   # no torch needed
python submit.py r01_array_sum examples/k_sum_1_reduce.ptx    # see a pass
python submit.py p00_scalar_add examples/k_sum_1_reduce.ptx   # wrong entry: a clean failure
python submit.py p00_scalar_add --compiler compile.py         # your compiler, once you have one
```

Then open `problems/p00_scalar_add/` and look at three files:

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `*.ir.json` | the Kernel IR — **the input to your compiler** |
| `*.ir.txt` | the same IR, pretty-printed for reading |
| `*.ref.cu` | Emmy's generated CUDA C++ — the reference answer, in a different target language |

Load an IR in Python:

```python
import json
from emmy.compiler.graph import Graph
g = Graph.from_dict(json.load(open("problems/r01_array_sum/k_sum_1_reduce.ir.json")))
body = g.nodes["sum_1"].op.body     # a tree of typed statements: Tile, StridedLoop, Load, ...
```

Your compiler walks that tree and prints PTX. Start with the common node kinds in the short table —
see [TASK.md](TASK.md) for the categories and the node-by-node translation table.

## The problems

15 open problems in 5 categories, easy → hard: **pointwise → reductions → matmul → fused →
attention-like**. Each is a folder under `problems/` with the IR, the reference, a launch
descriptor (`meta.json` — you never guess grid/block), and expected outputs (`expected.npz`).

**MVP: your compiler passes categories 1 and 2.** See [MVP.md](MVP.md).

Problems are scheduled for `sm_89`, and the runner is an **RTX 5090 (`sm_120`)**, where PTX written for `sm_89`
runs unchanged; [problems/PROVENANCE.md](problems/PROVENANCE.md)
says how they were generated and checked. The hidden evaluation set contains more problems of the *same kinds* —
different shapes and ops, no surprise concepts.

## Submitting

Submit at [riftstack.ai/hackathon/submit](https://riftstack.ai/hackathon/submit) before
**23:59 AoE on Tuesday, October 27**. A submission is:

- a **public GitHub repository** with `compile.py` at its root, runnable as
  `python compile.py path/to/kernel.ir.json > out.ptx`;
- a **video of 3 to 5 minutes** in which you walk through your compiler in your own voice
  (YouTube, Vimeo or Google Drive, shared so that anyone with the link can watch it).

Teams of up to three submit once and list every member. You can submit again until the
deadline; we review your latest entry. AI coding assistants are allowed, but your video has to
show that you understand how your compiler works — an entry where the understanding seems to
have been handed to an AI is not eligible for a prize.

## How compilers are evaluated

We run your `compile.py` on every kernel of the **hidden set** — the same five categories as the
open problems, with different shapes and ops — then assemble the PTX with `ptxas`, run it on the
runner's GPU under each problem's `meta.json` launch, and compare the outputs with the expected
ones within the problem's tolerance. This is the pipeline `submit.py --compiler` runs, so passing
the open set that way is the best preparation. Keep compiling to seconds per kernel: a time
limit may apply.

1. **Correctness on the hidden set, by category.** Passing categories 1 and 2 is the bar
   ([MVP.md](MVP.md)); each further category is what sets submissions apart.
2. **Code review** of your compiler is the first tiebreak. The IR → PTX lowering has to be your
   own — see the rule in [TASK.md](TASK.md).
3. **Speed** of the generated kernels is the last tiebreak.

The video decides prize eligibility, as described above.
